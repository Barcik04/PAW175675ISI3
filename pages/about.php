        Hi! I’m Igor Barcikowski, a passionate software developer and software engineering student from Poland.
        I specialize in backend development with Java and enjoy building powerful, scalable applications.
        Outside of coding, I was also a sailing coach for two years and have been involved in competitive sailing
        for the majority of my life.
